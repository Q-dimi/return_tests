# Adding a Test

1. see the example in examples/functions.js (add your test in the unit object with the three parameters)
2. add the test in suite.js (follow the format)
3. create the test file in /tests/yourfilename.js (make sure to format the string correctly in helpers/stringFormatter.js)
4. add the if condition after the long list of in build.js

<br>
All formats for every test are the same.
There are a few tests which are templated and empty which you can try.
