# /return-tests/tests

1. see the example in examples/functions.js (add your test in the unit object)
2. to make a test, write out must_be_x with the three parameters
3. add the test in the header of build.js and in the body of build.js (in the object and if condition)
4. create the test file in /tests/yourfilename.js
5. make sure to format the string correctly in helpers/stringFormatter.js

<br>
All formats for every test are the same.
There are a few tests which are templated but empty which you can try.
